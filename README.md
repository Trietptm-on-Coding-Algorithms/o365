# Office 365 Forensic and IR Tools

# o365auditor.py

This is a work in progress.  DO NOT assume the results produced by this script are complete.  In some cases I already know they are not.

Takes in exported (csv) Office 365 audit logs and parses them into a much more readable format.

    python o365auditor.py -f AuditLogs.csv -o myauditlogs
